We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

About Wealthfront

Our first chapter was about transforming the investment advisory business. We focused on unlocking access to low cost investing for delegators - people who were underserved by high fee and human financial advisors. We built the first automated portfolio that allows you in seconds to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies for a remarkably low fee, which resulted in attracting more than $25 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry.

Now, we’ve embarked on expanding into an adjacent opportunity to transform the digital self-directed brokerage space. This focus enables us to empower a dramatically wider audience to build long-term wealth - people who are eager to learn about investing by making their own investment decisions, but need guidance. In the last few years, several financial technology companies have made it incredibly accessible and engaging to trade in individual stocks, but because of their transaction based business models, these apps keep people focused on the day-to-day gyrations of the market leading to short-term thinking and behaviors. As a result, millions of people are investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks which is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We believe our vision serves their needs far better and that we can extend our core philosophy of embracing diversification, managing risk, minimizing fees and taxes and taking a long-term view, into self-directed investing. We believe this is an ideal opportunity to leverage our strength of building simple, easy-to-use products that offer a delightfully engaging experience to build long-term wealth.",$60 Per Hour(Employer est.),4.4,51 to 200 Employees,Company - Private,Financial Services,2011,Investment & Asset Management,Unknown / Non-Applicable

Murmuration,Associate Data Scientist,"New York, NY","About Murmuration/What We Do

Murmuration is a political strategy organization that is transforming the politics of education so that every child can benefit from equal access to equitable and high-quality public schools.

We empower campaigns, advocates, and organizers to better engage and mobilize communities to demand improvements to the public education system. We advise and support our partners in their efforts to plan and execute successful, data-driven electoral, organizing, and advocacy campaigns so that together we can transform the politics of education. And we build political influence, craft strategies, leverage data, and develop technology that enable our partners to accelerate progress, particularly those in traditionally marginalized communities.

Who We Are

Our team includes experts and innovators in data, analytics, and strategy. We are former teachers, organizers, data scientists, nonprofit executives, political campaign veterans, and more - and we are looking for people whose passion and expertise can help improve our work and realize our vision.

Background

Murmuration’s role is to support organizations and communities through our political systems, to raise the profile of the issue of public education such that more Americans will prioritize the needs of our students, and to leverage politics to help to create the broader context in which those on the front lines with our children can thrive. We are focused on transforming the politics of education—partnering with organizations across the country committed to organizing parents and communities around the issues of public education and educational equity, electing to office and holding accountable local leaders who will make improving public K-12 schools a priority, and advocating for policy changes with the goal of improving outcomes for children. To do this, we believe that it is critical that all of the political stakeholders—electoral organizations, advocacy and organizing groups, charter associations, networks of schools, districts, elected officials, and voters—contribute to a strong and politically savvy education sector that works together toward a common vision of improving public education.

About the Position

We are looking for a creative and endlessly inquisitive Associate Data Scientist to join our team. You are flexible and eager to contribute to a highly collaborative team. You will be working hand-in-hand with our Senior Data Scientist to develop highly optimized predictive models from a large volume of regularly updated data and to design experiments to test the effectiveness of various campaign tactics. In addition, you will be a key resource for building out custom analytics to help analyze our partners’ work in the political and advocacy spheres. You will be working in a small but dedicated, detail-oriented team that is committed to our mission. The Murmuration work environment is friendly, impact-driven, and highly collaborative.

Note: At Murmuration, we are committed to becoming an even more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. To this end, all staff members are expected to sit on and actively participate in DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) subcommittees. These subcommittees work to ensure that DEI is embedded in everything we do.

Key Responsibilities

Provide analytic insights for our partners throughout the lifecycle of their campaign(s), build and recommend custom models, provide real-time visualizations and analysis of campaign work, and produce post-campaign analytics to help our partners constantly learn from their efforts;
Create predictive models using the latest machine learning algorithms on relatively “big” data;
Explore data sets for insights that can help drive product improvements and feature prioritization;
Design and implement large-scale randomized controlled trials to gauge the general effectiveness of advocacy and campaign efforts;
Learn to work collaboratively in a technical environment with the goal of building tools that are constantly evolving based on our needs; and
Work closely with our partnerships team to identify and develop practical ways to apply our leading analytics to our partners’ problems.

Who You Are

The ideal candidate will have:
Studies and/or experience in political science, sociology, mathematics, statistics or other related field (preferred);
1-2 years experience performing general data analysis work or a Master’s degree, or equivalent, in Data Science;
Strong basic data science skills (data cleaning, munging, data analysis, and data visualization);
Training and experience with general purpose programming languages (SQL, Python, or R);

Data, Discovery, and Decision Science (D3) is the research and analytics organization at Allstate. In D3, you’ll be surrounded by 330+ tenacious and intellectually curious colleagues in an inclusive culture that encourages you to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good. We are solving some of today’s most complicated analytics problems, making the lives of our Allstate colleagues easier and more productive, and driving our mission to deliver targeted insurance solutions to our customers. We are partnering to incorporate analytics into every aspect of the enterprise. We are avid about learning new ways to get the most value from our massive data resources and leading-edge technology. We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. We strive to hire people from a wide variety of backgrounds so that we can better serve our increasingly diverse and multi-faceted customer base. Developing ourselves and others is key to our success.

D3’s Data Science Team is a key business partner to the Claims organization, supporting their leaders and end-users by developing solutions that will deliver the most advanced claim experience on the planet. We leverage data, technology, analytic capabilities, and business relationships to develop solutions to drive outstanding quality, effortless customer service and operational excellence. We are equally passionate about how our solutions benefit Allstate customers and claim professionals. By leveraging top talent from various quantitative disciplines, we collaborate with business partners and software engineers in development teams to create innovative products fueled by data science, artificial intelligence and industry insights.

Allstate’s goal is to use computer vision on photos/video and natural language processing of customer calls and sensor data from cars/homes to revolutionize how claims are handled. To go through this transformation, we require models that can extract meaning from the large amount of unstructured data customers supply us with for each claim. Below are a few examples of how we are using deep learning today:

NLP to predict who is at fault for an auto accident based on call recordings/transcripts of the accident. Knowing who is at fault allows for Allstate to pay our customers quickly.
Computer vision to identify the point of impact on a vehicle. Knowing the point of impact is critical for predicting if someone is injured in the vehicle or how much the vehicle is worth after the accident.
Computer vision to determine how to best repair damage to a vehicle.
NLP to extract information from a call. The question-and-answer pattern of our claim reporting system has many drop-down menus. This makes it easy to file a claim but isn’t always optimal for describing the nuances of each accident. By extracting extra meaning from the calls with NLP, we can get rich information out of the call for automation.

We are looking for someone who has deep expertise in computer vision or natural language processing who can take our deep learning to the next level.
Key Responsibilities

In this role, you will:
Identify new areas for deep learning that are not currently being worked on.
