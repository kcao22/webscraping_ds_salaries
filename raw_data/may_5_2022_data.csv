Allstate,Principal Data Scientist - Deep Learning (Remote - Home Based Worker),"Northbrook, IL","The world isn’t standing still, and neither is Allstate. We’re moving quickly, looking across our businesses and brands and taking bold steps to better serve customers’ evolving needs. That’s why now is an exciting time to join our team. You’ll have opportunities to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good.
You’ll do all this in an environment of excellence and the highest ethical standards – a place where values such as integrity, inclusive diversity and accountability are paramount. We empower every employee to lead, drive change and give back where they work and live. Our people are our greatest strength, and we work as one team in service of our customers and communities. Plus, Allstate is changing how, when, and where we work-to lead us boldly into our future. We're empowering our employees to create better ways of working through more intentional use of communication and collaboration practices, processes and tools.
Everything we do at Allstate is driven by a shared purpose: to protect people from life’s uncertainties so they can realize their hopes and dreams. For more than 89 years we’ve thrived by staying a step ahead of whatever’s coming next – to give customers peace of mind no matter what changes they face. We acted with conviction to advocate for seat belts, air bags and graduated driving laws. We help give survivors of domestic violence a voice through financial empowerment. We’ve been an industry leader in pricing sophistication, telematics, digital photo claims and, more recently, device and identity protection. We are the Good Hands. We don’t follow the trends. We set them. Job Summary
Data, Discovery, and Decision Science (D3) is the research and analytics organization at Allstate. In D3, you’ll be surrounded by 330+ tenacious and intellectually curious colleagues in an inclusive culture that encourages you to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good. We are solving some of today’s most complicated analytics problems, making the lives of our Allstate colleagues easier and more productive, and driving our mission to deliver targeted insurance solutions to our customers. We are partnering to incorporate analytics into every aspect of the enterprise. We are avid about learning new ways to get the most value from our massive data resources and leading-edge technology. We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. We strive to hire people from a wide variety of backgrounds so that we can better serve our increasingly diverse and multi-faceted customer base. Developing ourselves and others is key to our success.

D3’s Data Science Team is a key business partner to the Claims organization, supporting their leaders and end-users by developing solutions that will deliver the most advanced claim experience on the planet. We leverage data, technology, analytic capabilities, and business relationships to develop solutions to drive outstanding quality, effortless customer service and operational excellence. We are equally passionate about how our solutions benefit Allstate customers and claim professionals. By leveraging top talent from various quantitative disciplines, we collaborate with business partners and software engineers in development teams to create innovative products fueled by data science, artificial intelligence and industry insights.

Allstate’s goal is to use computer vision on photos/video and natural language processing of customer calls and sensor data from cars/homes to revolutionize how claims are handled. To go through this transformation, we require models that can extract meaning from the large amount of unstructured data customers supply us with for each claim. Below are a few examples of how we are using deep learning today:

NLP to predict who is at fault for an auto accident based on call recordings/transcripts of the accident. Knowing who is at fault allows for Allstate to pay our customers quickly.
Computer vision to identify the point of impact on a vehicle. Knowing the point of impact is critical for predicting if someone is injured in the vehicle or how much the vehicle is worth after the accident.
Computer vision to determine how to best repair damage to a vehicle.
NLP to extract information from a call. The question-and-answer pattern of our claim reporting system has many drop-down menus. This makes it easy to file a claim but isn’t always optimal for describing the nuances of each accident. By extracting extra meaning from the calls with NLP, we can get rich information out of the call for automation.

We are looking for someone who has deep expertise in computer vision or natural language processing who can take our deep learning to the next level.
Key Responsibilities

About Wealthfront

Our first chapter was about transforming the investment advisory business. We focused on unlocking access to low cost investing for delegators - people who were underserved by high fee and human financial advisors. We built the first automated portfolio that allows you in seconds to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies for a remarkably low fee, which resulted in attracting more than $25 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry.

Now, we’ve embarked on expanding into an adjacent opportunity to transform the digital self-directed brokerage space. This focus enables us to empower a dramatically wider audience to build long-term wealth - people who are eager to learn about investing by making their own investment decisions, but need guidance. In the last few years, several financial technology companies have made it incredibly accessible and engaging to trade in individual stocks, but because of their transaction based business models, these apps keep people focused on the day-to-day gyrations of the market leading to short-term thinking and behaviors. As a result, millions of people are investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks which is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We believe our vision serves their needs far better and that we can extend our core philosophy of embracing diversification, managing risk, minimizing fees and taxes and taking a long-term view, into self-directed investing. We believe this is an ideal opportunity to leverage our strength of building simple, easy-to-use products that offer a delightfully engaging experience to build long-term wealth.",$65K - $128K (Glassdoor est.),4.4,51 to 200 Employees,Company - Private,Financial Services,2011,Investment & Asset Management,Unknown / Non-Applicable

Allstate,Principal Data Scientist - Deep Learning (Remote - Home Based Worker),"Northbrook, IL","The world isn’t standing still, and neither is Allstate. We’re moving quickly, looking across our businesses and brands and taking bold steps to better serve customers’ evolving needs. That’s why now is an exciting time to join our team. You’ll have opportunities to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good.
You’ll do all this in an environment of excellence and the highest ethical standards – a place where values such as integrity, inclusive diversity and accountability are paramount. We empower every employee to lead, drive change and give back where they work and live. Our people are our greatest strength, and we work as one team in service of our customers and communities. Plus, Allstate is changing how, when, and where we work-to lead us boldly into our future. We're empowering our employees to create better ways of working through more intentional use of communication and collaboration practices, processes and tools.
Everything we do at Allstate is driven by a shared purpose: to protect people from life’s uncertainties so they can realize their hopes and dreams. For more than 89 years we’ve thrived by staying a step ahead of whatever’s coming next – to give customers peace of mind no matter what changes they face. We acted with conviction to advocate for seat belts, air bags and graduated driving laws. We help give survivors of domestic violence a voice through financial empowerment. We’ve been an industry leader in pricing sophistication, telematics, digital photo claims and, more recently, device and identity protection. We are the Good Hands. We don’t follow the trends. We set them. Job Summary
Data, Discovery, and Decision Science (D3) is the research and analytics organization at Allstate. In D3, you’ll be surrounded by 330+ tenacious and intellectually curious colleagues in an inclusive culture that encourages you to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good. We are solving some of today’s most complicated analytics problems, making the lives of our Allstate colleagues easier and more productive, and driving our mission to deliver targeted insurance solutions to our customers. We are partnering to incorporate analytics into every aspect of the enterprise. We are avid about learning new ways to get the most value from our massive data resources and leading-edge technology. We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. We strive to hire people from a wide variety of backgrounds so that we can better serve our increasingly diverse and multi-faceted customer base. Developing ourselves and others is key to our success.

D3’s Data Science Team is a key business partner to the Claims organization, supporting their leaders and end-users by developing solutions that will deliver the most advanced claim experience on the planet. We leverage data, technology, analytic capabilities, and business relationships to develop solutions to drive outstanding quality, effortless customer service and operational excellence. We are equally passionate about how our solutions benefit Allstate customers and claim professionals. By leveraging top talent from various quantitative disciplines, we collaborate with business partners and software engineers in development teams to create innovative products fueled by data science, artificial intelligence and industry insights.

Allstate’s goal is to use computer vision on photos/video and natural language processing of customer calls and sensor data from cars/homes to revolutionize how claims are handled. To go through this transformation, we require models that can extract meaning from the large amount of unstructured data customers supply us with for each claim. Below are a few examples of how we are using deep learning today:

NLP to predict who is at fault for an auto accident based on call recordings/transcripts of the accident. Knowing who is at fault allows for Allstate to pay our customers quickly.
Computer vision to identify the point of impact on a vehicle. Knowing the point of impact is critical for predicting if someone is injured in the vehicle or how much the vehicle is worth after the accident.
Computer vision to determine how to best repair damage to a vehicle.
NLP to extract information from a call. The question-and-answer pattern of our claim reporting system has many drop-down menus. This makes it easy to file a claim but isn’t always optimal for describing the nuances of each accident. By extracting extra meaning from the calls with NLP, we can get rich information out of the call for automation.

We are looking for someone who has deep expertise in computer vision or natural language processing who can take our deep learning to the next level.

We’re moving quickly, looking across our businesses and brands and taking bold steps to better serve customers’ evolving needs. That’s why now is an exciting time to join our team. You’ll have opportunities to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good.
You’ll do all this in an environment of excellence and the highest ethical standards – a place where values such as integrity, inclusive diversity and accountability are paramount. We empower every employee to lead, drive change and give back where they work and live. Our people are our greatest strength, and we work as one team in service of our customers and communities.

Everything we do at Allstate is driven by a shared purpose: to protect people from life’s uncertainties so they can realize their hopes and dreams.

We set them. Job Summary
Data, Discovery, and Decision Science (D3) is the research and analytics organization at Allstate. In D3, you’ll be surrounded by 330+ tenacious and intellectually curious colleagues in an inclusive culture that encourages you to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good. We are solving some of today’s most complicated analytics problems, making the lives of our Allstate colleagues easier and more productive, and driving our mission to deliver targeted insurance solutions to our customers. We are partnering to incorporate analytics into every aspect of the enterprise. We are avid about learning new ways to get the most value from our massive data resources and leading-edge technology. We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. We strive to hire people from a wide variety of backgrounds so that we can better serve our increasingly diverse and multi-faceted customer base. Developing ourselves and others is key to our success.

D3’s Data Science Team is a key business partner to the Claims organization, supporting their leaders and end-users by developing solutions that will deliver the most advanced claim experience on the planet. We leverage data, technology, analytic capabilities, and business relationships to develop solutions to drive outstanding quality, effortless customer service and operational excellence. We are equally passionate about how our solutions benefit Allstate customers and claim professionals. By leveraging top talent from various quantitative disciplines, we collaborate with business partners and software engineers in development teams to create innovative products fueled by data science, artificial intelligence and industry insights.

Allstate’s goal is to use computer vision on photos/video and natural language processing of customer calls and sensor data from cars/homes to revolutionize how claims are handled. To go through this transformation, we require models that can extract meaning from the large amount of unstructured data customers supply us with for each claim. Below are a few examples of how we are using deep learning today:

NLP to predict who is at fault for an auto accident based on call recordings/transcripts of the accident. Knowing who is at fault allows for Allstate to pay our customers quickly.
Computer vision to identify the point of impact on a vehicle. Knowing the point of impact is critical for predicting if someone is injured in the vehicle or how much the vehicle is worth after the accident.
Computer vision to determine how to best repair damage to a vehicle.
NLP to extract information from a call. The question-and-answer pattern of our claim reporting system has many drop-down menus. This makes it easy to file a claim but isn’t always optimal for describing the nuances of each accident. By extracting extra meaning from the calls with NLP, we can get rich information out of the call for automation.

We are looking for someone who has deep expertise in computer vision or natural language processing who can take our deep learning to the next level.

Data, Discovery, and Decision Science (D3) is the research and analytics organization at Allstate. In D3, you’ll be surrounded by 330+ tenacious and intellectually curious colleagues in an inclusive culture that encourages you to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good. We are solving some of today’s most complicated analytics problems, making the lives of our Allstate colleagues easier and more productive, and driving our mission to deliver targeted insurance solutions to our customers.

We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. We strive to hire people from a wide variety of backgrounds so that we can better serve our increasingly diverse and multi-faceted customer base. Developing ourselves and others is key to our success.

D3’s Data Science Team is a key business partner to the Claims organization, supporting their leaders and end-users by developing solutions that will deliver the most advanced claim experience on the planet. We leverage data, technology, analytic capabilities, and business relationships to develop solutions to drive outstanding quality, effortless customer service and operational excellence. We are equally passionate about how our solutions benefit Allstate customers and claim professionals. By leveraging top talent from various quantitative disciplines, we collaborate with business partners and software engineers in development teams to create innovative products fueled by data science, artificial intelligence and industry insights.

Allstate’s goal is to use computer vision on photos/video and natural language processing of customer calls and sensor data from cars/homes to revolutionize how claims are handled. To go through this transformation, we require models that can extract meaning from the large amount of unstructured data customers supply us with for each claim. Below are a few examples of how we are using deep learning today:

NLP to predict who is at fault for an auto accident based on call recordings/transcripts of the accident. Knowing who is at fault allows for Allstate to pay our customers quickly.
Computer vision to identify the point of impact on a vehicle. Knowing the point of impact is critical for predicting if someone is injured in the vehicle or how much the vehicle is worth after the accident.
Computer vision to determine how to best repair damage to a vehicle.
NLP to extract information from a call. The question-and-answer pattern of our claim reporting system has many drop-down menus. This makes it easy to file a claim but isn’t always optimal for describing the nuances of each accident. By extracting extra meaning from the calls with NLP, we can get rich information out of the call for automation.

We are looking for someone who has deep expertise in computer vision or natural language processing who can take our deep learning to the next level.
Key Responsibilities

In this role, you will:
Identify new areas for deep learning that are not currently being worked on.

Work collaboratively and transparently with teammates to create a strong team culture.
Proactively support the team in ideation of how to approach a problem and reviewing results of model building.
Share modeling progress and results with our business partners to build excitement and enthusiasm for our work.
This role is for someone with lots of deep learning experience. This person will help expand the teams theoretical understanding of deep learning.

Supervisory Responsibilities:
This job has no supervisory duties. However, you will be expected to mentor junior data scientists on the team. Preferred Qualifications

Allstate,Principal Data Scientist - Deep Learning (Remote - Home Based Worker),"Northbrook, IL","The world isn’t standing still, and neither is Allstate. We’re moving quickly, looking across our businesses and brands and taking bold steps to better serve customers’ evolving needs. That’s why now is an exciting time to join our team. You’ll have opportunities to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good.
You’ll do all this in an environment of excellence and the highest ethical standards – a place where values such as integrity, inclusive diversity and accountability are paramount. We empower every employee to lead, drive change and give back where they work and live. Our people are our greatest strength, and we work as one team in service of our customers and communities. Plus, Allstate is changing how, when, and where we work-to lead us boldly into our future. We're empowering our employees to create better ways of working through more intentional use of communication and collaboration practices, processes and tools.
Everything we do at Allstate is driven by a shared purpose: to protect people from life’s uncertainties so they can realize their hopes and dreams. For more than 89 years we’ve thrived by staying a step ahead of whatever’s coming next – to give customers peace of mind no matter what changes they face. We acted with conviction to advocate for seat belts, air bags and graduated driving laws. We help give survivors of domestic violence a voice through financial empowerment. We’ve been an industry leader in pricing sophistication, telematics, digital photo claims and, more recently, device and identity protection. We are the Good Hands. We don’t follow the trends. We set them. Job Summary
Data, Discovery, and Decision Science (D3) is the research and analytics organization at Allstate. In D3, you’ll be surrounded by 330+ tenacious and intellectually curious colleagues in an inclusive culture that encourages you to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good. We are solving some of today’s most complicated analytics problems, making the lives of our Allstate colleagues easier and more productive, and driving our mission to deliver targeted insurance solutions to our customers. We are partnering to incorporate analytics into every aspect of the enterprise. We are avid about learning new ways to get the most value from our massive data resources and leading-edge technology. We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. We strive to hire people from a wide variety of backgrounds so that we can better serve our increasingly diverse and multi-faceted customer base. Developing ourselves and others is key to our success.

D3’s Data Science Team is a key business partner to the Claims organization, supporting their leaders and end-users by developing solutions that will deliver the most advanced claim experience on the planet. We leverage data, technology, analytic capabilities, and business relationships to develop solutions to drive outstanding quality, effortless customer service and operational excellence. We are equally passionate about how our solutions benefit Allstate customers and claim professionals. By leveraging top talent from various quantitative disciplines, we collaborate with business partners and software engineers in development teams to create innovative products fueled by data science, artificial intelligence and industry insights.

Allstate’s goal is to use computer vision on photos/video and natural language processing of customer calls and sensor data from cars/homes to revolutionize how claims are handled. To go through this transformation, we require models that can extract meaning from the large amount of unstructured data customers supply us with for each claim. Below are a few examples of how we are using deep learning today:

NLP to predict who is at fault for an auto accident based on call recordings/transcripts of the accident. Knowing who is at fault allows for Allstate to pay our customers quickly.
Computer vision to identify the point of impact on a vehicle. Knowing the point of impact is critical for predicting if someone is injured in the vehicle or how much the vehicle is worth after the accident.
Computer vision to determine how to best repair damage to a vehicle.
NLP to extract information from a call. The question-and-answer pattern of our claim reporting system has many drop-down menus. This makes it easy to file a claim but isn’t always optimal for describing the nuances of each accident. By extracting extra meaning from the calls with NLP, we can get rich information out of the call for automation.

We are looking for someone who has deep expertise in computer vision or natural language processing who can take our deep learning to the next level.

Allstate,Principal Data Scientist - Deep Learning (Remote - Home Based Worker),"Northbrook, IL","The world isn’t standing still, and neither is Allstate. We’re moving quickly, looking across our businesses and brands and taking bold steps to better serve customers’ evolving needs. That’s why now is an exciting time to join our team. You’ll have opportunities to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good.
You’ll do all this in an environment of excellence and the highest ethical standards – a place where values such as integrity, inclusive diversity and accountability are paramount. We empower every employee to lead, drive change and give back where they work and live. Our people are our greatest strength, and we work as one team in service of our customers and communities. Plus, Allstate is changing how, when, and where we work-to lead us boldly into our future. We're empowering our employees to create better ways of working through more intentional use of communication and collaboration practices, processes and tools.
Everything we do at Allstate is driven by a shared purpose: to protect people from life’s uncertainties so they can realize their hopes and dreams. For more than 89 years we’ve thrived by staying a step ahead of whatever’s coming next – to give customers peace of mind no matter what changes they face. We acted with conviction to advocate for seat belts, air bags and graduated driving laws. We help give survivors of domestic violence a voice through financial empowerment. We’ve been an industry leader in pricing sophistication, telematics, digital photo claims and, more recently, device and identity protection. We are the Good Hands. We don’t follow the trends. We set them. Job Summary
Data, Discovery, and Decision Science (D3) is the research and analytics organization at Allstate. In D3, you’ll be surrounded by 330+ tenacious and intellectually curious colleagues in an inclusive culture that encourages you to take risks, challenge the status quo and shape the future for the greater good. We are solving some of today’s most complicated analytics problems, making the lives of our Allstate colleagues easier and more productive, and driving our mission to deliver targeted insurance solutions to our customers. We are partnering to incorporate analytics into every aspect of the enterprise. We are avid about learning new ways to get the most value from our massive data resources and leading-edge technology. We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. We strive to hire people from a wide variety of backgrounds so that we can better serve our increasingly diverse and multi-faceted customer base. Developing ourselves and others is key to our success.

D3’s Data Science Team is a key business partner to the Claims organization, supporting their leaders and end-users by developing solutions that will deliver the most advanced claim experience on the planet. We leverage data, technology, analytic capabilities, and business relationships to develop solutions to drive outstanding quality, effortless customer service and operational excellence. We are equally passionate about how our solutions benefit Allstate customers and claim professionals. By leveraging top talent from various quantitative disciplines, we collaborate with business partners and software engineers in development teams to create innovative products fueled by data science, artificial intelligence and industry insights.

Allstate’s goal is to use computer vision on photos/video and natural language processing of customer calls and sensor data from cars/homes to revolutionize how claims are handled. To go through this transformation, we require models that can extract meaning from the large amount of unstructured data customers supply us with for each claim. Below are a few examples of how we are using deep learning today:

NLP to predict who is at fault for an auto accident based on call recordings/transcripts of the accident. Knowing who is at fault allows for Allstate to pay our customers quickly.
Computer vision to identify the point of impact on a vehicle. Knowing the point of impact is critical for predicting if someone is injured in the vehicle or how much the vehicle is worth after the accident.
Computer vision to determine how to best repair damage to a vehicle.
NLP to extract information from a call. The question-and-answer pattern of our claim reporting system has many drop-down menus. This makes it easy to file a claim but isn’t always optimal for describing the nuances of each accident. By extracting extra meaning from the calls with NLP, we can get rich information out of the call for automation.

We are looking for someone who has deep expertise in computer vision or natural language processing who can take our deep learning to the next level.
