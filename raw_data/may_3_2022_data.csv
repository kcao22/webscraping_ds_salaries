Our Senior Data Scientist would need to integrate new data sources into our backend platform, review existing ML models and create a new supervised NLP deep learning model using the integrated data sources and custom taxonomy to categorize data according to that taxonomy. This could include the creation of new data processing pipelines, and various ML processes including data preparation, feature selection, training, classification, and deployment workflows.
Our Current Stack: AWS to host the infrastructure, including the CICD
Core app: Java (SpringBoot)+ Angular, Python, Kubernetes, EMR, Spark, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, Openpyxl, Streamlit, Watchdog, spacy-lookups-data, sklearn, seaborn, nltk, matplotlib, pandas, spacy, SQLAlchemy
Role Responsibilities:
Integrate new data sources into the existing backend, ensuring interoperability and integrity with the current platform flows
Prepare new ML processes and define areas for improvement for existing ML processes
Work in close collaboration with back-end engineers to ensure compatibility of changes

"Karus, Inc.",Senior Credit Risk Data Scientist,Remote,"About Karus
Karus enables institutions to offer competitive funding on retail auto purchases and refinancings. Through our extensive dealer network, auto borrowers are sourced and scored using Karus’ proprietary machine-learning decisioning tool. Our credit models, which have been trained on millions of borrowers and vehicles, open up financing opportunities for subprime and nearprime cohorts that have traditionally been disqualified by credit agencies.
For the first time, Karus-powered institutions are able to participate in a newly democratized lending ecosystem that offers unparalleled opportunities for risk-adjusted returns while also benefiting dealers and end borrowers.
The Problem We Solve
Karus has built machine learning models that more accurately predict the solvency of an auto borrower. Our data science work clearly shows that:
Auto lenders have focused on loan level and investment level structure techniques to reduce risk, rather than accurately pricing the borrower.
At the loan level, lenders use levers like higher APR’s or a reliance on recoveries from the underlying collateral to mitigate risk.
At the investment level, securitizations and subordinate credit tranches are created to limit risk.
Karus is mitigating risk by truly understanding how the borrower will perform with their auto debt.
Position Summary (Data scientist)
As a data scientist for Karus, you will be entrusted with significant responsibility. The primary function of this role will be to support our data science and machine learning work streams. We are looking for a candidate who will grow into a leadership role with us.
