Are you seeking an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others? Has the impact of the economic inequality, social injustice and systemic financial challenges left you feeling unsettled? Join this non-profit organization and be part of the movement that helps economic growth and opportunity for under-served individuals and small business in the communities you live in. We are dedicated to financial dignity and inclusion as we equip adults and young people with the financial education, coaching and connections to secure a better future, facilitating a journey to financial independence.
We are seeking a DATA SCIENTIST to analyze and manage data for actionable insights. The candidate best suited for this role knows how to extract meaning from and interpret data, which requires both tools and methods from statistics and machine learning, as well as being human. S/he spends a lot of time in the process of collecting, cleaning, and munging data, because data is never clean. This process requires persistence, statistics, and software engineering skills—skills that are also necessary for understanding biases in the data, and for debugging logging output from code.
Once the data is in shape, a crucial part is exploratory data analysis, which combines visualization and data sense. The preferred candidate can find patterns, build models, and algorithms—some with the intention of understanding usage and others to serve as prototypes that ultimately get baked back into our work. The Data Scientist may design experiments and is a critical part of data-driven decision making. This role will communicate with Teammates, Program Operations staff and Leadership in clear language and with data visualizations so that even if colleagues are not immersed in the data themselves, they will understand the implications.

"Creyon Bio, Inc.",Machine Learning Engineer/ Scientist,Remote,"Who you are
You are a Machine Learning scientist/engineer who has demonstrable mastery in both mathematical foundations and algorithm development in machine learning and numerical methods. You enjoy solving hard problems, writing high-quality code and are excited to be part of a startup building a platform using pharmacological datasets, genomics, chemistry, physics, and machine learning to revolutionize the creation of new medicines. You care deeply about helping people through the development of novel therapeutics.
You are passionate about working closely with experimentalists to iteratively build models through a continuous conceptualize/build/test/re-conceptualize cycle. You excel at developing concepts by understanding research literature, exploring new libraries and tools, and discussing with research scientists in ML. You are capable and motivated to quickly get up to speed with relevant concepts in physics, chemistry and biology, so that you can effectively discuss your modeling efforts with research scientists in these fields. You can work independently to turn concepts into ML-models and test these models on synthetic data that you generate as well as data obtained from experiments at Creyon and externally. You feel ownership of the models that you develop and are comfortable using these models to recommend follow-on experiments. You are comfortable working in multiple software languages and can learn new ones as needed, and have experience in at least one compiled language (Rust, C++, Java, etc.).
Your interests may include building sparsity-driven methods, Bayesian (probabilistic graphical) models, signal processing & noise models, message-passing models etc. You may have worked on language models (attention) applied to RNA/genomics or protein biology. You may have been fascinated by geometric deep learning for molecular design.
We are looking for someone who is excited to grow with the company and is open to stepping into expanded opportunities as they arise. Your presence will invariably refine the team that we are and will become.
This position can be remote, with an expectation of periodic travel to visit the rest of the team in person in the San Diego office (frequency depending on your location). SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HIGHLY PREFERRED

Who we are
We are a venture-backed nascent biotech-pharma company with a razor focus on solving one of the biggest problems in the industry—drugs cost too much and take too long to develop. We transform discovery and development of new medicines into engineering problems, shunning the costly and inefficient prevailing paradigm of trial-and-error screening. We envision engineering new personalized medicines immediately following actionable genetic diagnosis. Our mission is to make gene-centric medicines affordable and rapidly available to patients globally. Our CTO was previously at Google where she gained experience leading teams that work with machine learning researchers.
As cross-disciplinary scientists and industry veterans, we have recruited a remarkable team of scientific advisors and early partners. We, and our investors, are committed to building a company that will disrupt the pharmaceutical industry. We value intense scientific and engineering innovation as the driver of such a change. We have a very employee-friendly vacation policy, flexible schedule, and highly competitive compensation, health-care benefits, and employee stock plans.
