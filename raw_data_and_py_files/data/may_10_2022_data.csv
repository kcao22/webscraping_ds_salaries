Murmuration,Associate Data Scientist,"New York, NY","About Murmuration/What We Do

Murmuration is a political strategy organization that is transforming the politics of education so that every child can benefit from equal access to equitable and high-quality public schools.

We empower campaigns, advocates, and organizers to better engage and mobilize communities to demand improvements to the public education system. We advise and support our partners in their efforts to plan and execute successful, data-driven electoral, organizing, and advocacy campaigns so that together we can transform the politics of education. And we build political influence, craft strategies, leverage data, and develop technology that enable our partners to accelerate progress, particularly those in traditionally marginalized communities.

Who We Are

Our team includes experts and innovators in data, analytics, and strategy. We are former teachers, organizers, data scientists, nonprofit executives, political campaign veterans, and more - and we are looking for people whose passion and expertise can help improve our work and realize our vision.

Background

Murmuration’s role is to support organizations and communities through our political systems, to raise the profile of the issue of public education such that more Americans will prioritize the needs of our students, and to leverage politics to help to create the broader context in which those on the front lines with our children can thrive. We are focused on transforming the politics of education—partnering with organizations across the country committed to organizing parents and communities around the issues of public education and educational equity, electing to office and holding accountable local leaders who will make improving public K-12 schools a priority, and advocating for policy changes with the goal of improving outcomes for children. To do this, we believe that it is critical that all of the political stakeholders—electoral organizations, advocacy and organizing groups, charter associations, networks of schools, districts, elected officials, and voters—contribute to a strong and politically savvy education sector that works together toward a common vision of improving public education.

About the Position

We are looking for a creative and endlessly inquisitive Associate Data Scientist to join our team. You are flexible and eager to contribute to a highly collaborative team. You will be working hand-in-hand with our Senior Data Scientist to develop highly optimized predictive models from a large volume of regularly updated data and to design experiments to test the effectiveness of various campaign tactics. In addition, you will be a key resource for building out custom analytics to help analyze our partners’ work in the political and advocacy spheres. You will be working in a small but dedicated, detail-oriented team that is committed to our mission. The Murmuration work environment is friendly, impact-driven, and highly collaborative.

Note: At Murmuration, we are committed to becoming an even more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. To this end, all staff members are expected to sit on and actively participate in DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) subcommittees. These subcommittees work to ensure that DEI is embedded in everything we do.

Key Responsibilities

Provide analytic insights for our partners throughout the lifecycle of their campaign(s), build and recommend custom models, provide real-time visualizations and analysis of campaign work, and produce post-campaign analytics to help our partners constantly learn from their efforts;
Create predictive models using the latest machine learning algorithms on relatively “big” data;
Explore data sets for insights that can help drive product improvements and feature prioritization;
Design and implement large-scale randomized controlled trials to gauge the general effectiveness of advocacy and campaign efforts;
Learn to work collaboratively in a technical environment with the goal of building tools that are constantly evolving based on our needs; and
Work closely with our partnerships team to identify and develop practical ways to apply our leading analytics to our partners’ problems.

Who You Are

The ideal candidate will have:
Studies and/or experience in political science, sociology, mathematics, statistics or other related field (preferred);
1-2 years experience performing general data analysis work or a Master’s degree, or equivalent, in Data Science;
Strong basic data science skills (data cleaning, munging, data analysis, and data visualization);
Training and experience with general purpose programming languages (SQL, Python, or R);
Experience data mining large datasets (familiarity with voterfile or Census data is a plus);
Basic understanding of machine learning concepts;
Strong understanding of basic statistical techniques and how to apply them to a variety of real-world datasets;
Strong problem-solving skills as well as the ability to manage several tasks/projects concurrently and prioritize work effectively; and

We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

About Wealthfront

Our first chapter was about transforming the investment advisory business. We focused on unlocking access to low cost investing for delegators - people who were underserved by high fee and human financial advisors. We built the first automated portfolio that allows you in seconds to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies for a remarkably low fee, which resulted in attracting more than $25 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry.

Now, we’ve embarked on expanding into an adjacent opportunity to transform the digital self-directed brokerage space. This focus enables us to empower a dramatically wider audience to build long-term wealth - people who are eager to learn about investing by making their own investment decisions, but need guidance. In the last few years, several financial technology companies have made it incredibly accessible and engaging to trade in individual stocks, but because of their transaction based business models, these apps keep people focused on the day-to-day gyrations of the market leading to short-term thinking and behaviors. As a result, millions of people are investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks which is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We believe our vision serves their needs far better and that we can extend our core philosophy of embracing diversification, managing risk, minimizing fees and taxes and taking a long-term view, into self-directed investing. We believe this is an ideal opportunity to leverage our strength of building simple, easy-to-use products that offer a delightfully engaging experience to build long-term wealth.",$78K - $137K (Glassdoor est.),4.4,51 to 200 Employees,Company - Private,Financial Services,2011,Investment & Asset Management,Unknown / Non-Applicable
