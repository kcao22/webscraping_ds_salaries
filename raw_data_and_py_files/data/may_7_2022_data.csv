Square,"Data Scientist, Payment Acceptance APIs","New York, NY","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

Partner with Square's product, engineering and operations teams to make data-driven decisions using a diverse set of tactics, including statistics, quantitative reasoning, and experimental design.
Proactively identify gaps and opportunities in our processes. Design, run, and analyze experiments with the goal of optimizing the speed, cost, and acceptance of payments for our sellers.
Independently research questions related to our core payments data and produce actionable insights for stakeholders.
Build ETL pipelines, dashboards and machine learning models that enable monitoring of the health and performance of our core business.
Be the subject matter expert on payments data. Translate requests from all partner teams into questions that can be rigorously answered with payments data.
Communicate analysis and decisions to high-level stakeholders and executives in verbal, visual, and written media.
Own, coordinate, and solve complex, cross-functional problems that extend beyond the traditional boundaries of product domains, analytics, and data science.
Promote data best practices and be an advocate for a data-driven culture across Square.
Lead and mentor others in data science on medium and long-term initiatives that span across product domains.

Qualifications
2+ years of industry experience in data science, product analytics, or machine learning-focused roles

We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

About Wealthfront

Our first chapter was about transforming the investment advisory business. We focused on unlocking access to low cost investing for delegators - people who were underserved by high fee and human financial advisors. We built the first automated portfolio that allows you in seconds to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies for a remarkably low fee, which resulted in attracting more than $25 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry.

Now, we’ve embarked on expanding into an adjacent opportunity to transform the digital self-directed brokerage space. This focus enables us to empower a dramatically wider audience to build long-term wealth - people who are eager to learn about investing by making their own investment decisions, but need guidance. In the last few years, several financial technology companies have made it incredibly accessible and engaging to trade in individual stocks, but because of their transaction based business models, these apps keep people focused on the day-to-day gyrations of the market leading to short-term thinking and behaviors. As a result, millions of people are investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks which is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We believe our vision serves their needs far better and that we can extend our core philosophy of embracing diversification, managing risk, minimizing fees and taxes and taking a long-term view, into self-directed investing. We believe this is an ideal opportunity to leverage our strength of building simple, easy-to-use products that offer a delightfully engaging experience to build long-term wealth.",$78K - $137K (Glassdoor est.),4.4,51 to 200 Employees,Company - Private,Financial Services,2011,Investment & Asset Management,Unknown / Non-Applicable

Square,"Data Scientist, Payment Acceptance APIs","New York, NY","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Partner with Square's product, engineering and operations teams to make data-driven decisions using a diverse set of tactics, including statistics, quantitative reasoning, and experimental design.
Proactively identify gaps and opportunities in our processes. Design, run, and analyze experiments with the goal of optimizing the speed, cost, and acceptance of payments for our sellers.
Independently research questions related to our core payments data and produce actionable insights for stakeholders.
Build ETL pipelines, dashboards and machine learning models that enable monitoring of the health and performance of our core business.
Be the subject matter expert on payments data. Translate requests from all partner teams into questions that can be rigorously answered with payments data.
Communicate analysis and decisions to high-level stakeholders and executives in verbal, visual, and written media.
Own, coordinate, and solve complex, cross-functional problems that extend beyond the traditional boundaries of product domains, analytics, and data science.
Promote data best practices and be an advocate for a data-driven culture across Square.
Lead and mentor others in data science on medium and long-term initiatives that span across product domains.

Qualifications
2+ years of industry experience in data science, product analytics, or machine learning-focused roles

Square,"Data Scientist, Payment Acceptance APIs","New York, NY","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Independently research questions related to our core payments data and produce actionable insights for stakeholders.
Build ETL pipelines, dashboards and machine learning models that enable monitoring of the health and performance of our core business.
Be the subject matter expert on payments data. Translate requests from all partner teams into questions that can be rigorously answered with payments data.
Communicate analysis and decisions to high-level stakeholders and executives in verbal, visual, and written media.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Square,"Data Scientist, Payment Acceptance APIs","New York, NY","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Square,"Data Scientist, Payment Acceptance APIs","New York, NY","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Partner with Square's product, engineering and operations teams to make data-driven decisions using a diverse set of tactics, including statistics, quantitative reasoning, and experimental design.
Proactively identify gaps and opportunities in our processes. Design, run, and analyze experiments with the goal of optimizing the speed, cost, and acceptance of payments for our sellers.
Independently research questions related to our core payments data and produce actionable insights for stakeholders.
Build ETL pipelines, dashboards and machine learning models that enable monitoring of the health and performance of our core business.
Be the subject matter expert on payments data. Translate requests from all partner teams into questions that can be rigorously answered with payments data.
Communicate analysis and decisions to high-level stakeholders and executives in verbal, visual, and written media.
Own, coordinate, and solve complex, cross-functional problems that extend beyond the traditional boundaries of product domains, analytics, and data science.
Promote data best practices and be an advocate for a data-driven culture across Square.
Lead and mentor others in data science on medium and long-term initiatives that span across product domains.

Qualifications
2+ years of industry experience in data science, product analytics, or machine learning-focused roles

Square,"Data Scientist, Payment Acceptance APIs","New York, NY","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.
